## 🧠 How It Works

Each AI agent specializes in one task and works with available tools to solve part of the travel planning problem:

| Agent Role           | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| Travel Specialist     | Finds budget-friendly flights according to the distance given |
| Accommodation Expert | Recommends stays based on comfort and cost |
| Activity Planner      | Creates a schedule of local attractions and activities |

Agents are orchestrated through a `TravelCrew` object that assigns tasks and collects results.

## 📦 Customization

Want to add more agents or change models?

- Add new tools to the `Tool` class.
- Define new `Agent` objects with custom roles and goals.
- Modify the `completion()` call to use other LLMs like `gpt-4`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`, or local ones (e.g., LLaMA via Ollama).
